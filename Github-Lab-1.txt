Github Lab 1: Collaboration

Instructions: In this lab we will play a game of literary ‘exquisite corpse’. The idea is we will write a story where each student writes one paragraph of the story based on the last paragraph. 

For this assignment please edit this file by opening it into a text program like TextEdit / Microsoft Word. Please keep the story PG. No use of cursing, racism, sexist, homophobia, intense graphic violence imagery, overt sexual speech will be tolerated. When you start your paragraph please write your name at the top.

When you are done with the paragraph please separate your section by using the a line of underscores. You can do this by holding shift + hypen (-)

As the crowd drew closer, Jack grew frightened of the rampant footsteps. He turns away and ran at full speed.

This cat belonged to Jill. Little did she know that her pet got out of the house.

A large amount of water was spit in the mouth of Jack, and the water washed away Jill's cat.

Jack coughed out the water and out came a magical fish.

And for his final wish, Jack asked to have an endless supply of French fries. The fish granted these three wishes and quickly disappeared. Jack was then left with a lovely black bubble jacket. He tested his voice by singing out, "Give me my fries." His voice was soft and elegant, and a big plate of fries appeared in his hands.

A large crowd of people gathered around Jack to hear his beautiful voice.

As the crowd gathered, Jack began to weep. In all his life all he had ever wanted was acceptance.

Acceptance doesn't come easy but Jack knew in time it would all work out. Jack and Jill traveled to Australia for their first time. This was the adventure vacation they were dreaming of for years. They were adrenaline junkies with a minimalist lifestyle. Three months past, I guess they decided to extend their travels.
